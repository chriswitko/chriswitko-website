        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <h1>Chris Witko</h1>
        <p align="justify">Hi. My name is Chris Witko. I live in London. I’m a Full Stack Developer. For the last two years, I worked for Inskin Media Ltd in London as a Senior Developer. 
        <br />I started my career almost 20 years ago. Last two years I worked as a team member of 6 developers. I'm responsible for support and develop internal applications, but also build a new one, and actively support the whole team. 
        <br />On my everyday basis, I love to build up my skills in programming. Recently I "fall in love" with testing frameworks (Jest is freaking super), Styled-Components and React are my everyday stack. I always complain about a lack of time, but part of my spare time I spend on side-projects, which are the best way to learn. Recently, I’ve released my two side projects (<a href="https://thepressreview.com" target="_blank">https://thepressreview.com</a>) where I used React, Redux, Sagas, and ApiLab (<a href="https://github.com/chriswitko/apilab" target="_blank">https://github.com/chriswitko/apilab)</a> to upgrade my skills with Node, Mongo and testing.
        <br />I’m currently learning more about Machine Learning using simple algorithms to build recommendations engines, and also learn to use TensorFlow.
        <br />I hope that this short intro helps you to learn a little bit about me. I'm open to discussion and learn about your company, team and projects.
